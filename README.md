#  Azure-Carbon-Estimator alias Azure-importer 

> [!NOTE] > `Azure Importer`  is a Microsoft open source project  to help calculate emissions from Azure workloads.The project is under development and hence please use the source code for experimentation and research

The Azure importer plugin allows you to provide some basic details about Azure resources and automatically populate your `manifest` with usage metrics that can then be passed along a plugin pipeline to calculate energy and carbon impacts.The importer uses Impact Framework (https://if.greensoftware.foundation/) which uses the  Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specifications to calculate emissions of workloads running on Azure. 

Based on our analysis we have observed that the workloads running on any compute, storage or network platforms draw energy from the underlying host. This energy can be measured through metrics like CPU utilization, memory utilization etc. By measuring these metrices over fixed time period and passing them through the IF computational pipeline we will be able to calculate the SCI score for these workloads on Azure.

The plugin will use the Azure Monitor API to collect observations from Azure resources and feed them into the Impact Framework computation pipeline. The project will also support batch API and multiple metrics for the SCI calculation.

The importer will take the subscriptionID and resource group name as input and run through all the azure services deployed in that specific resource group.

## Architecture
In most applications developed for Azure , the resource group and/or the subscription serve as the bounded context . i.e. all the components of the application are deployed entirely in a single resource group or spread across multiple resource groups within the same subscription.

Hence if we want to automate the calculation of software emissions for an entire application that is built on Azure with the help of the Impact Framework, we should have the capability to provide just the subscription ID and the pipeline should calculate the end result.

Following are the different components that we can envision in the Azure carbon estimator tool:

* A configuration module that allows the user to specify the Azure resources, metrics, and time range for collecting observations. In our case this is the manifest file.
* An API client module that interacts with the Azure Monitor API to retrieve the metric values for the specified resources and time range.
* The Impact Framework computation pipeline that takes the output from Azure importer and provides the operational and embodied emissions. For doing this the impact framework has multiple plugins added into it's computational pipeline like Teads Curve, Cloud Metadata, Cloud Carbon Footprint, SCI-E, SCI-O, SCI and so on. The details of how the plugins are stitched together to get the output is detailed out in the Process section below.

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the Azure importer plugin extension.

## Get Started 

The base version of code in this repository enables you to do this calculation for a workload running in an Azure VM instance.Use the below steps to get started.

### 1. Create an Azure VM instance

You can create one using [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com). You also need to create a metrics application for that virtual machine and assign the relevant permissions.

### 2. Provide an identity to access VM metadata and metrics

The Azure Importer uses [AzureDefaultCredentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-dotnet) method which is an abstraction for different scenarios of authentication.

- When hosting the IF Azure Importer on an Azure service, you can provide a [managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).
- When running the Azure Importer outside of Azure, e.g. on your local machine, you can use an [App registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) (an App registration is a representation of a technical service principal account; you can view it as an identity for your App on Azure).

The following steps in this tutorial use a service principal. You can learn more at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app

### Create An App registration/service principal for the Azure Importer

On the Azure Portal, search for **App registrations**, then create a new one with default values.

Then create a credential secret for this App registration, to use it for authentication with the Azure Importer => note that secret
![image](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if-docs/assets/966110/c3f380e1-2bc9-471f-b212-ce8c31a158b1)

Then, on the Overview Tab, copy/paste the **client_id** and **tenant_id** for this App registration
![image](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if-docs/assets/966110/e1615088-9ee6-41ef-a340-7ab72c1bc488)

Now we have credentials to authenticate to Azure as the service principal (of this App registration)

### 3. Provide IAM access

Next, we need to provide access rights to this service principal to the test VM (or its resource group).

On the IAM Tab of the Resource Group that contains the VM, add a new Role Assignment

![image](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if-docs/assets/966110/0588530c-bd67-4876-b26b-c076d5cda08d)

We'll need 2 role Assignments:

- Reader
- Monitoring Reader

![image](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if-docs/assets/966110/52af6111-dde3-4f99-8739-769d72fdb5d8)

Then Add the service principal you created as a member for the Role assignment
![image](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if-docs/assets/966110/be097243-66a7-421a-9cee-e8fe77906a82)

Repeat for the role Monitoring Reader

### 4. Add credentials to `.env`

Create a `.env` file in the IF project root directory. This is where you can store your Azure authentication details. Your `.env` file should look as follows:

```txt
AZURE_TENANT_ID: <your-tenant-id>
AZURE_CLIENT_ID: <your-client-id>
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: <your-client-secret>
```

## Node config

- `azure-observation-window`: The time interval between measurements (temporal resolution) as a string with a value and a unit, e.g. `5 mins`. The value and unit must be space-separated.
- `azure-observation-aggregation`: This indicates how you want metrics to be aggregated between each `interval`. The recommended default is `average`.
- `azure-subscription-id`: Your Azure subscription ID, e.g. 9cf5e19b-8b18-4c37-9541-55fc47ad70c3
- `azure-resource-group`: Your Azure resource group name
- `azure-vm-name`: Your virtual machine name

## Inputs

All that remains is to provide the details about your virtual machine in the `inputs` field in your `manifest`.
These are the required fields:

- `timestamp`: An ISO8601 timestamp indicating the start time for your observation period. We work out your `timespan` by adding `duration` to this initial start time.
- `duration`: Number of seconds your observation period should last. We add this number of seconds to `timestamp` to work out when your observation period should stop.

These are all provided as `inputs`. You also need to instantiate an `azure-importer` plugin to handle the Azure-specific `input` data. Here's what a complete `manifest` could look like:

```yaml
name: azure-demo
description: example manifest invoking Azure plugin
initialize:
  plugins:
    azure-importer:
      method: AzureImporter
      path: 'https://github.com/microsoft/azure-carbon-estimator'
tree:
  children:
    child:
      pipeline:
        - azure-importer
      config:
        azure-importer:
          azure-observation-window: 5 min
          azure-observation-aggregation: 'average'
          azure-subscription-id: 9cf5e19b-8b18-4c37-9541-55fc47ad70c3
          azure-resource-group: my_group
          azure-vm-name: my_vm
      inputs:
        - timestamp: '2023-11-02T10:35:31.820Z'
          duration: 3600
```

This will grab Azure metrics for `my_vm` in `my_group` for a one hour period beginning at 10:35 UTC on 2nd November 2023, at 5 minute resolution, aggregating data occurring more frequently than 5 minutes by averaging.

## Outputs

The Azure importer plugin will enrich your `manifest` with the following data:

- `duration`: the per-input duration in seconds, calculated from `azure-observation-window`
- `cpu/utilization`: percentage CPU utilization
- `cloud/instance-type`: VM instance name
- `location`: VM region
- `memory/available/GB`: Amount of memory _not_ in use by your application, in GB.
- `memory/used/GB`: Amount of memory being used by your application, in GB. Calculated as the difference between `memory/capacity/GB` and `memory/available/GB`.
- `memory/capacity/GB`: The total memory allocated to your virtual machine, in GB.
- `memory/utilization`: memory utilized, expressed as a percentage (`memory-usedGB`/`memory/capacity/GB` \* 100)

These can be used as inputs in other plugins in the pipeline. Typically, the `instance-type` can be used to obtain `tdp-finder` data that can then, along with `cpu/utilization`, feed a plugin such as `teads-curve`.

The outputs look as follows:

```yaml
outputs:
  - timestamp: '2023-11-02T10:35:00.000Z'
    duration: 300
    cpu/utilization: '0.314'
    memory/available/GB: 0.488636416
    memory/used/GB: 0.5113635839999999
    memory/capacity/GB: '1'
    memory/utilization: 51.13635839999999
    location: uksouth
    cloud/instance-type: Standard_B1s
  - timestamp: '2023-11-02T10:40:00.000Z'
    duration: 300
    cpu/utilization: '0.314'
    memory/available/GB: 0.48978984960000005
    memory/used/GB: 0.5102101504
    memory/capacity/GB: '1'
    memory/utilization: 51.021015039999995
    location: uksouth
    cloud/instance-type: Standard_B1s
```

You can run this example `manifest` by saving it as `./examples/manifests/test/azure-importer.yml` and executing the following command from the project root:

```sh
npm i -g @grnsft/if
npm i -g @grnsft/if-unofficial-plugins
ie --manifest ./examples/manifests/test/azure-importer.yml --output ./examples/outputs/azure-importer.yml
```

The results will be saved to a new `yaml` file in `./examples/outputs`.
